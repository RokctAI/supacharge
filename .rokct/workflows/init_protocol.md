# SOP: Initialize/Re-initialize Rokct Protocol (Local)

**Trigger**: You are returning to a project where `.rokct/` already exists, or you need to refresh the protocol configuration.

## Procedure

1. **Run the Local Initiator**:

    * **Windows/Unix/macOS**:

        ```bash
        python .rokct/initiate.py
        ```

2. **Confirm Setup**:

    * The script will update templates and ensure all required protocol files are present.

3. **Done**:

    * The protocol is now initialized/re-initialized. You can proceed to start a new session.

4. **Session End**:

    * Run `python .rokct/end_protocol.py` once your work in the project is completely done to clean up the protocol environment.
