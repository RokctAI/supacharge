# Committed Google faces

Inter, Montserrat and Roboto, all under the
[SIL Open Font License 1.1](OFL.txt). `AppStyle`'s whole type scale is
`GoogleFonts.inter(...)` and `GoogleFonts.montserrat(...)`, google_fonts
fetches faces at runtime, and a widget test has no network — without a real
face every glyph renders as the FlutterTest block font and the PNG is
worthless.

These are the exact files Google serves. google_fonts addresses every face as
`https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/a/<sha256>.ttf`, so **the file name is the
checksum**, and `render_screen_test.dart` serves them back through
google_fonts' own `@visibleForTesting` http seam. google_fonts then takes its
normal path and verifies each file's length *and* SHA-256 before registering
it — so the render is provably the real face, and no hash is hard-coded in
the harness.

`AppStyle` declares three *italic* Montserrat styles (`logoFontBoldItalic`,
`logoFontBlackItalic`, `logoMottoRegularItalic`). google_fonts resolves an
italic as a separate face with its own checksum, so those are committed too
even though the profile screen this harness renders does not currently use
them — an uncommitted face fails the whole run loudly, and a logo style is
exactly the kind of thing a future section would reach for.

Roboto is the one face google_fonts is never asked for: nothing in `AppStyle`
calls `GoogleFonts.roboto`, but a `TextStyle` that names no family resolves to
the platform default, which under `flutter test` is the FlutterTest block
font. It is therefore registered directly with a `FontLoader` under the plain
family name rather than through the google_fonts seam.

They are **not** app assets: nothing here is declared in `pubspec.yaml`, so
none of it ships in a build. The harness reads them straight off disk.

## Adding a face

A weight or family nobody committed 404s through the offline client and fails
the run loudly, naming the URL. To add one, read the expected hash out of
google_fonts' own table for that family
(`google_fonts/lib/src/google_fonts_parts/part_<letter>.g.dart`), then:

```bash
curl -sSL -o "test/render/fonts/<hash>.ttf" "https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/a/<hash>.ttf"
```

and add a row above. The same table is what a google_fonts version bump would
change — which is why a bump surfaces as an honest 404 rather than a silently
wrong render.
